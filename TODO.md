## Important
* adjust masstodon for non-orbitrap data
    * providing the interval length
    * assure that different intervals do not intersect
        * if they do, make them shorter
* adjust bokeh library (before the weekend)
    * contact Kola
* multiprocessing batch files
    * run on all orbitrap data
    * run on all previous data
        * compare with last results
* write wrappers for importing other types of files
* rewrite the paper
    * plots with multiple experiments in the paper
    * simplify the picts on deconvolution

## Elegant
* analysis of fitting sensitivity
* l1 optimization algorithm  
* get rid of the intervaltree (it generates hidden warnings)



DONE:
* quality of fit
    * errors for each deconvolution problem
    * writing down to csv
