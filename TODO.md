## Important
* write CLI

## Elegant
* analysis of fitting sensitivity
* l1 optimization algorithm
* get rid of the intervaltree
* passing of the parameter:
    * the parameters should be stored as dictionaries.
    * the docs should have references to check up on them.
* write a test comparing the output of different deconvolution methods.


DONE:
* quality of fit
    * errors for each deconvolution problem
    * writing down to csv
* rewrite the paper
    * plots with multiple experiments in the paper
    * simplify the picts on deconvolution
* multiprocessing batch files
    * run on all orbitrap data
    * run on all previous data
        * compare with last results
* adjust masstodon for non-orbitrap data
    * providing the interval length
    * assure that different intervals do not intersect
        * if they do, make them shorter
